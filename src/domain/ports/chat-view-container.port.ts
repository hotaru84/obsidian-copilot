/**
 * Port for chat view containers
 *
 * This interface defines the contract for all chat view implementations
 * (sidebar, floating, future code-block). It enables unified view management
 * for features like focus tracking, broadcast commands, and multi-view operations.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - viewId is unique across all view types
 * - viewType enables type-specific filtering
 * - Lifecycle methods (onActivate/onDeactivate) are called by ChatViewRegistry
 * - Broadcast methods mirror ChatView's existing registerInputCallbacks interface
